# This is a live Mask-R-CNN foo, that can detect all coco classes in Real-Time!

It is mostly the code from matterport/Mask_RCNN (it uses the mrcnn library), also the initial idea came from markjay4k/Mask-RCNN-series, 
but I adapted it to plain pip without env and fixed some compability issues with the mrcnn library.
